# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Setting up the project structure
- Initializing memory bank documentation
- Understanding the existing codebase
- Documenting component and project architecture

## Recent Changes

- Initialized Memory Bank documentation
- Explored project structure
- Created components-structure.md documenting component organization
- Created project-structure.md documenting overall source code organization

## Next Steps

- Examine existing components and templates in more detail
- Understand data flow and integration points
- Review current implementation patterns
- Identify areas for improvement or expansion
- Document template structure and composition definitions

## Active Decisions

- Documentation approach through Memory Bank
- Understanding Remotion workflow and patterns
- Component-based architecture documentation

## Current Challenges

- Mapping the complete architecture
- Identifying all data integration points
- Understanding template customization options
- Understanding how data flows from sports APIs to video components

## Questions to Explore

- How are sports data sources integrated?
- What is the current template creation workflow?
- How are assets managed in the system?
- What are the main performance bottlenecks?
- How do templates and compositions relate to each other?
- What is the rendering pipeline for video generation?
