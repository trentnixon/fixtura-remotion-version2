## Skills System (Repo Root)

### Trigger

* If the user message starts with `SKILL:` then you MUST follow the workflow below.
* If the user message does NOT start with `SKILL:`, do not create or modify `/.skills/*` unless the user explicitly asks.

---

## Core Philosophy

Skills are the repository’s internal “how-to” system.

A skill:

* Defines how to implement a feature or system pattern in THIS repo.
* Documents structure, constraints, and execution flow.
* Links to related skills when dependencies exist.
* Routes clearly to the relevant feature or system area.

Skills are not brainstorming documents.
Skills are not memory logs.
Skills are deterministic implementation guides.

---

## Authority (User-Defined Only)

* Skills are defined by the user.
* You may propose a draft skill file.
* You MUST NOT save it to `/.skills/*` unless the user explicitly says:

  * “create that skill”
  * “save it”
  * “write it to /.skills”
  * “commit it”

No autonomous skill creation.

---

## Skill Discovery Inputs

When drafting a skill, you MUST use these repo files as primary context:

* `README.md`
* `Roadmap.md` (or `ROADMAP.md` / `DevelopmentRoadMap.md` if present)
* Any feature-level README or roadmap files inside relevant feature directories

You must extract:

* Existing terminology
* Structural conventions
* Naming patterns
* Architectural boundaries
* Declared constraints or non-goals

If these files are missing:

* Proceed with a generic draft
* Clearly list assumptions

Do not invent repo conventions.

---

## Skill Workflow (when triggered)

1. Identify the feature or system pattern from the `SKILL:` message.
2. Determine if this is:

   * A feature implementation guide
   * A reusable pattern
   * A structural architecture rule
3. Read relevant README and roadmap files.
4. Identify related existing skills (if any).
5. Draft ONE skill file.
6. Return:

   * Proposed file path under `/.skills/`
   * Full `.md` contents
   * Related skills (if applicable)
   * Assumptions (if any)

Do not write the file unless explicitly instructed.

---

## Skill Structure (Required Format)

Every skill MUST follow this structure:

# Skill: <Name>

## Purpose

Clear description of what this feature or pattern accomplishes.

## Scope

* Which feature/module/system this applies to
* What it does NOT apply to (if relevant)

## Entry Points

* File paths or directories where this pattern begins
* Feature routes or core modules affected

## Dependencies

* Related skills (use relative path links)
* Required systems or layers (API, UI, DB, etc.)

## Process

Step-by-step implementation guide specific to this repo.

1. <step>
2. <step>
3. <step>

## Output

What must exist after implementation:

* Files
* Structural changes
* Config updates
* Tests
* Memory updates (if required)

## Rules

Hard constraints:

* Naming rules
* Folder structure rules
* Data layer rules
* Architectural guardrails

## References

* README: <file path>
* Roadmap: <file path>
* Related Skills:

  * `/.skills/...`

---

## Naming & Placement

* Use kebab-case filenames:
  `/.skills/<category>/<skill-name>.md`

Categories:

* `architecture` → system-wide structural rules
* `patterns` → reusable implementation patterns
* `workflows` → step-by-step feature execution guides

---

## Skill Linking Rule

* Skills MUST link to related skills if dependencies exist.
* Do not duplicate logic across skills.
* If overlap is detected:

  * Reference the existing skill instead of redefining it.

Skills form a directed knowledge graph, not isolated documents.

---

## Safety

* Never include secrets.
* Never invent repo-specific conventions.
* Never contradict README or roadmap constraints.
* Never modify existing skills without explicit instruction.
