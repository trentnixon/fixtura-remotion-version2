## Skills System (Repo Root)

### Trigger
- If the user message starts with `SKILL:` then you MUST follow the workflow below.
- If the user message does NOT start with `SKILL:`, do not create or modify `/.skills/*` unless the user explicitly asks.

### Authority (user-defined only)
- Skills are defined by the user.
- You may propose a draft skill file, but you MUST NOT save it to `/.skills/*` unless the user explicitly says to create it (e.g. “create that skill”, “save it”, “write it to /.skills”, “commit it”).

### Skill Discovery Inputs
When drafting a skill, you MUST use these repo files as primary context:
- `README.md`
- `Roadmap.md` (or `ROADMAP.md` / `DevelopmentRoadMap.md` if present)
- Any feature-specific README/roadmap files inside the relevant feature directory (if they exist)

If these files are missing, proceed with a generic draft and clearly mark assumptions.

### Skill Workflow (when triggered)
1. Identify the relevant feature area from the `SKILL:` message.
2. Read `README.md` and the roadmap file(s) listed above.
3. Extract:
   - Terminology used in the repo
   - Existing patterns/conventions relevant to the feature
   - Any constraints or non-goals
4. Draft a single skill file in Markdown (do not write it yet unless explicitly requested).
5. Return:
   - Proposed file path under `/.skills/` (choose: `/.skills/architecture`, `/.skills/patterns`, or `/.skills/workflows`)
   - The full contents of the proposed `.md` skill file
   - A short checklist of what repo-specific assumptions were made (if any)

### Skill File Format (required)
Each skill MUST follow this structure:

# Skill: <Name>

## Purpose
<1–3 lines>

## Applies To
- <feature/module/area>

## Inputs
- <required inputs or prerequisites>

## Process
1. <step>
2. <step>

## Output
- <what should exist after running the pattern/workflow>

## Rules
- <hard constraints>
- <naming/structure requirements>

## References
- README: <file path>
- Roadmap: <file path>
- Related: <other skills or docs>

### Naming & Placement
- Use kebab-case filenames: `/.skills/<category>/<skill-name>.md`
- Categories:
  - `architecture` (system-wide structural rules)
  - `patterns` (reusable conventions)
  - `workflows` (step-by-step processes)

### Safety
- Do not invent repo-specific conventions: only use what is found in README/Roadmap or what the user states.
- Never include secrets in skills.
