# Scheduler → Remotion: Sponsors payload v2

**From:** Scheduler (Creators data path)
**To:** Remotion / composition team
**Date:** 2026-08-21
**Related:** `.comms/cms-handoff-scheduler-sponsors-payload-v2.md` (CMS → Scheduler)
**Status:** Scheduler ingestion live for cricket asset data. Remotion layout / dual placement still to adopt.

---

## Why this exists

CMS changed how sponsors are allocated and shipped. Scheduler now normalises that into the **download / composition JSON** Remotion already consumes.

This doc is the contract for **what Remotion reads on an asset**. It is not the raw CMS `AccountTheme.sponsors` shape.

---

## Breaking change (legacy → v2)

| Gone (do not read)                                  | Use instead                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `result.primary` / `result.default` / `result.aux`  | See buckets below                                      |
| CMS `sponsorNum` on AccountTheme                    | Scheduler-derived `videoMeta.club.sponsors.sponsorNum` |
| Looking up league/grade/team maps yourself from CMS | `data[].assignSponsors` (already matched)              |

---

## Sponsor DTO (every logo)

```ts
{
  id: number;
  name: string;
  logo: {
    id: number;
    url: string;
  }
}
```

No other fields are guaranteed.

---

## Where sponsors live on an asset

```txt
videoMeta.club.sponsors          ← account-level (whole video)
videoMeta.club.sponsors.primary  ← up to 4 account primaries
videoMeta.club.sponsors.general  ← ordered generals (outro / group)
videoMeta.club.sponsors.sponsorNum ← primary.length + general.length
videoMeta.data.includeSponsors   ← true when sponsorNum > 0

data[n].primaryForScreen         ← primaries for THIS content row’s screens
data[n].assignSponsors           ← entity sponsor(s) for THIS content row
data[n].assignSponsors.competition
data[n].assignSponsors.grade
data[n].assignSponsors.team
```

Buckets stay **separate**. Remotion chooses placement; Scheduler does not merge primary + general + entity into one list.

---

## Allocation model (what each bucket means)

| Bucket                        | Scope       | Typical use                                        | Max / notes                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary**                   | Account     | Individual screens (always available on the asset) | Up to **4**                                                                                        |
| **General**                   | Account     | End-of-video / group sponsor sequence              | Ordered; not mixed into primary                                                                    |
| **Entity (`assignSponsors`)** | Content row | Screen alongside primary for that game/grade/team  | Club → **team**; Association → **grade**; `competition` reserved (usually `[]` until CMS ships it) |

### Club vs Association

- **Club:** use `assignSponsors.team` (grade array empty).
- **Association:** use `assignSponsors.grade` (team array empty).
- Never expect both team and grade filled for the same account type.

### Screen composition (per content row)

Scheduler attaches:

1. **`primaryForScreen`** — account primaries for that row, with **entity-wins** applied: if the same sponsor `id` is already in that row’s `assignSponsors`, it is omitted from `primaryForScreen`. Account-level `videoMeta.club.sponsors.primary` is **not** mutated.
2. **`assignSponsors`** — sponsors matched to ids present on that row (grade id and/or team ids).

**Full house example:** 4 primaries + 1 grade/team assign → up to **5** logos relevant to one screen item (`primaryForScreen` + the non-empty assign array).

Verified Association example (Results row):

```txt
primaryForScreen: [211, 212, 213, 214]   // 4
assignSponsors.grade: [220]              // 1
assignSponsors.team: []
assignSponsors.competition: []
```

## Account-level shape (template)

```json
{
  "videoMeta": {
    "club": {
      "sponsors": {
        "primary": [
          {
            "id": 211,
            "name": "1",
            "logo": { "id": 31204, "url": "https://…" }
          },
          {
            "id": 212,
            "name": "2",
            "logo": { "id": 31205, "url": "https://…" }
          }
        ],
        "general": [
          {
            "id": 215,
            "name": "5",
            "logo": { "id": 31208, "url": "https://…" }
          }
        ],
        "sponsorNum": 16
      }
    },
    "data": {
      "includeSponsors": true
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `primary` / `general` here are **arrays of sponsor DTOs** (not `{ sponsors: [...] }` — that nested form is CMS-only).
- `sponsorNum` = `primary.length + general.length` (primary counted first for sequencing / timing).
- Existing outro timing that uses `sponsorNum` (e.g. pages of 6) can keep using this derived number.

---

## Per-row shape (content)

```json
{
  "gradeName": "O60 Div 2 - Kerry Emery Shield",
  "assignSponsors": {
    "competition": [],
    "grade": [
      { "id": 220, "name": "10", "logo": { "id": 31213, "url": "https://…" } }
    ],
    "team": []
  },
  "primaryForScreen": [
    { "id": 211, "name": "1", "logo": { "id": 31204, "url": "https://…" } },
    { "id": 212, "name": "2", "logo": { "id": 31205, "url": "https://…" } },
    { "id": 213, "name": "3", "logo": { "id": 31206, "url": "https://…" } },
    { "id": 214, "name": "4", "logo": { "id": 31207, "url": "https://…" } }
  ]
}
```

**Prefer for on-screen primary placement:** `data[n].primaryForScreen` (already deduped vs that row’s entity).
**Prefer for entity placement:** the non-empty of `assignSponsors.grade` or `assignSponsors.team`.
**Prefer for outro / group:** `videoMeta.club.sponsors.general` (and timings via `sponsorNum` / `includeSponsors`).

---

## Empty / missing

- No sponsors → empty arrays and `sponsorNum: 0` / `includeSponsors: false` (or absent truthy count). Do not treat as an error.
- Missing entity match → the relevant `assignSponsors.*` array is `[]`.

---

## Remotion ownership (this phase)

**Scheduler already does**

- Ingest CMS v2
- Put account primary + general on the template
- Match entity sponsors onto content rows
- Derive `sponsorNum` / `includeSponsors`
- Compose `primaryForScreen` (entity wins on duplicate ids)

**Remotion still owns**

- Visual layout / dual placement (where primary vs general vs entity appear on compositions)
- Any merge of primary + general for a single UI sequence (if product still wants that)
- Handling assets that do not yet carry `primaryForScreen` / v2 `assignSponsors` until those compositions are migrated

---

## Cricket coverage (Scheduler)

Entity + `primaryForScreen` wired on live cricket paths that attach sponsors to content rows, including:

- Weekend / Cricket Results
- Upcoming fixtures
- Ladder

Confirm per composition before assuming every Remotion input file has the new fields.

---

## Quick checklist for Remotion

- [ ] Stop reading legacy `result.primary` / `result.default` / `result.aux`
- [ ] Read account primaries / generals from `videoMeta.club.sponsors.{primary,general}`
- [ ] Use `data[].primaryForScreen` for per-screen primary logos
- [ ] Use `data[].assignSponsors.grade` (Association) or `.team` (Club) for entity logos
- [ ] Keep using `sponsorNum` / `includeSponsors` for outro gating and timing
- [ ] Design for up to **4** primaries + **1** entity on a content screen (5 logos)
