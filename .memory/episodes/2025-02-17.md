## Context

User requested updates to the Brickwork–Graphics–CricketResults component, starting with the result scores/teams section and metadata.

## Work Done

- Duplicated `TeamsSectionLogoAndScore` → `TeamsSectionLogoAndScore-BrickWork.tsx` (Brickwork-only; original unchanged)
- Removed "VS" from Brickwork teams section (sync verification)
- Logo sizing: fit container height (capped 120px), passed `height={teamsHeight}` from cards
- Moved background from parent to both team blocks (home + away); parent transparent
- Added `gap-2` to match PlayerStats
- Logos flush to edge (removed mr-4, ml-4)
- Removed border bottom from teams section
- Scores: px-2, Climate Crisis font (title), font-normal, text-2xl
- Scores centered in containers; parent layout updated (h-full, flex-1, justify-between)
- Created `MatchHeaderBrickWork.tsx`: metadata with copy font, no container bg, `onBackgroundMain` variant
- Moved metadata under scores (TeamsSection → MatchHeader → MatchStatus → PlayerStats)
- Replaced ground with grade: `grade={match.gradeName}` in Brickwork cards
- Added `fontFamily` override to `ResultMetaData` primitive
- Added optional `grade` and made `ground` optional in `MatchHeaderProps`

## Decisions

- Brickwork results metadata uses copy font (Roboto), not title font, per user feedback
- Brickwork metadata shows grade instead of ground

## Results

- Brickwork Cricket Results has distinct teams/scores section and metadata styling
- `TeamsSectionLogoAndScore-BrickWork`, `MatchHeaderBrickWork` in use
- card-BrickWork and card-BrickWork-clubOnly updated

## Next

- [ ] Optional: further Brickwork refinements if needed
- [ ] Utils cleanup (TKT-2025-009 et al.) remains pending from prior focus

## Context (Brickwork Ladder)

User requested Brickwork ladder display updates: row styling, logo sizing, header alignment, and copy variants.

## Work Done (Brickwork Ladder)

- Created `row-BrickWork.tsx` with stronger transparent row backgrounds (strong/medium vs low/subtle)
- Created `BalancedLadderRowBrickWork` in TableRowLayout: full-height logo, no border-b, no row padding, flush top/bottom
- Stats section: `self-stretch items-center` for flush top/bottom bg
- Team section: px-2 → pr-2, removed mr-2; logo cell no px/mx
- Team name: wrapper with pl-2
- Created `headerBrickWork.tsx`: layout matched to row (70%, flex-1, w-10/w-10/w-10/w-10/w-20), grade variant `onContainerCopyNoBg`
- display-BrickWork now uses RowBrickWork and TableHeaderBrickWork

## Results

- Brickwork ladder: aligned header (P W L B PTS), full-height logos, flush stats bg, stronger row backgrounds, consistent spacing (pl-2 team name, pr-2 team section)

---

## Context (Brickwork Upcoming)

User requested Brickwork Upcoming composition updates: styling, logos, metadata, layout.

## Work Done (Brickwork Upcoming)

- game-card-brickWork: stronger bg (medium), onContainerCopyNoBg for metadata and team names, removed VS, removed borders
- Removed parent p-2 from TeamNameWrapped (Brickwork only consumer)
- Logos: removed rounded-full; fit="cover" with full-space fill; moved to flex-1 parent, fixed height 140px
- Column layout 20/60/20: flex 2:6:2 ratio (logos 20%, meta 60%, logos 20%)
- Added variant prop to TeamNameWrapped (onContainerCopyNoBg)

## Results

- Brickwork Upcoming: uniform card styling, cover logos with fixed height, uniform middle column

## Context (Brickwork Team Roster)

User requested Brickwork variant for team roster composition.

## Work Done (Brickwork Team Roster)

- Created `brickwork.tsx`, `display-BrickWork.tsx`, `playerList-brickWork.tsx`
- Wired `CricketRoster.brickwork` to rosterBrickwork
- Player list: each row with `backgroundTransparent.medium`, `onContainerCopyNoBg`, no p-4
- Middle section: smaller logos (200/80 vs 300/120), gap-2, p-2 removed from logos column
- Centered roster vertically: `flex-shrink-0`, `items-center` (replaced flex-1, items-stretch)
- All metadata stacked at bottom (grade, date, ground, round)
- Added `compact` prop to LargeTeamHeader: removes p-2, my-2, p-4 from container and logo wrapper when true
- 60/40 fixed width split: player list flex 6, logos flex 4
- Metadata font bumped to text-[26px] (~+2pt)

## Results

- Brickwork Team Roster: compact layout, stacked metadata at bottom, 60/40 split, compact logos

## Context (Font Integration – Dhurjati, Allerta Stencil)

User requested integration of new fonts and assignment to the Brickwork theme.

- Integrated **Allerta Stencil** per font skill: fontPathMap, fontNameVariants, index.ts (display category)
- Set Brickwork primary font to **Allerta Stencil** (title, subtitle); copy remains Roboto
- Dhurjati remains in system for future use

## Results

- Dhurjati and Allerta Stencil available via loadFontByName and theme config
- Brickwork compositions use Allerta Stencil for titles/subtitles
