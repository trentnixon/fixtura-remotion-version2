# Episode — 2025-02-16

## Context

User requested documentation of work completed today. Three architecture skills were created for key folders in the Remotion video composition system.

## Work Done

- Created skill: `.skills/architecture/templates-folder-structure.md` — covers `src/templates/` and subfolders (base, types, variants), variant creation patterns, registry, readMe conventions
- Created skill: `.skills/architecture/cricket-ladder-folder.md` — covers `src/compositions/cricket/ladder/`, variant entry pattern, controller/Display/TeamRows, layout, modules, export chain
- Created skill: `.skills/architecture/cricket-performances-folder.md` — covers `src/compositions/cricket/performances/`, screen pagination, dual composition types (batting/bowling), data transformation, PerformancesDisplay/PlayerRow structure

## Decisions

- None (skill creation follows existing repo conventions from README and how-to docs)

## Results

- Three architecture skills now available for agent/LLM reference when working with templates, ladder, and performances folders
- Skills stored in `.skills/architecture/` with consistent format: Purpose, Applies To, Inputs, Process, Output, Rules, References

## Next

- [ ] Optionally create skills for other cricket compositions (top5, results, upcoming, etc.)
- [ ] Verify skills are discoverable when agent works in those folders

---

## Session 2: Cricket Skills Completion & Skill References

### Work Done

- Created additional cricket composition skills: `cricket-results-folder`, `cricket-result-single-folder`, `cricket-team-of-the-week-folder`, `cricket-team-roster-folder`, `cricket-top5-folder`, `cricket-upcoming-folder`
- Created feature-level skill: `cricket-compositions-feature.md` — covers 8 composition types, variant system, export structure, routing, implementation order
- Added skill references to all folder `.docs/readMe.md` (or README.md): ladder, results, resultSingle, top5, upcoming, teamRoster, TeamOfTheWeek, performances, cricket feature root, templates
- Created missing `readMe.md` for `top5` and `upcoming` (both now have full folder contracts with skill refs)

### Results

- 10 architecture skills in `.skills/architecture/` with bidirectional links from folder docs
- Every cricket composition folder and the cricket feature root now references its skill in `.docs/readMe.md`

### Next

- [ ] Test that skills provide useful context when agent works in those folders
- [ ] Optionally extend skill-ref pattern to other areas (e.g. sponsorFooter, utils)
