# Episode — 2025-02-16

## Context

User requested documentation of work completed today. Three architecture skills were created for key folders in the Remotion video composition system.

## Work Done

- Created skill: `.skills/architecture/templates-folder-structure.md` — covers `src/templates/` and subfolders (base, types, variants), variant creation patterns, registry, readMe conventions
- Created skill: `.skills/architecture/cricket-ladder-folder.md` — covers `src/compositions/cricket/ladder/`, variant entry pattern, controller/Display/TeamRows, layout, modules, export chain
- Created skill: `.skills/architecture/cricket-performances-folder.md` — covers `src/compositions/cricket/performances/`, screen pagination, dual composition types (batting/bowling), data transformation, PerformancesDisplay/PlayerRow structure

## Decisions

- None (skill creation follows existing repo conventions from README and how-to docs)

## Results

- Three architecture skills now available for agent/LLM reference when working with templates, ladder, and performances folders
- Skills stored in `.skills/architecture/` with consistent format: Purpose, Applies To, Inputs, Process, Output, Rules, References

## Next

- [ ] Optionally create skills for other cricket compositions (top5, results, upcoming, etc.)
- [ ] Verify skills are discoverable when agent works in those folders

---

## Session 2: Cricket Skills Completion & Skill References

### Work Done

- Created additional cricket composition skills: `cricket-results-folder`, `cricket-result-single-folder`, `cricket-team-of-the-week-folder`, `cricket-team-roster-folder`, `cricket-top5-folder`, `cricket-upcoming-folder`
- Created feature-level skill: `cricket-compositions-feature.md` — covers 8 composition types, variant system, export structure, routing, implementation order
- Added skill references to all folder `.docs/readMe.md` (or README.md): ladder, results, resultSingle, top5, upcoming, teamRoster, TeamOfTheWeek, performances, cricket feature root, templates
- Created missing `readMe.md` for `top5` and `upcoming` (both now have full folder contracts with skill refs)

### Results

- 10 architecture skills in `.skills/architecture/` with bidirectional links from folder docs
- Every cricket composition folder and the cricket feature root now references its skill in `.docs/readMe.md`

### Next

- [ ] Test that skills provide useful context when agent works in those folders
- [ ] Optionally extend skill-ref pattern to other areas (e.g. sponsorFooter, utils)

## Session 3: Core Utils Documentation & Utils Cleanup Planning

### Work Done

- Updated all colorSystem readMe files (root, config, core, generators, utils) with detailed file descriptions and exports
- Created skill: `color-system-folder.md`; added skill ref to colorSystem readMe
- Updated createThemeUtils readMe files (root, core, generators)
- Created skill: `create-theme-utils-folder.md`; added skill ref
- Updated designPalettes readMe
- Created skill: `design-palettes-folder.md`; added skill ref
- Updated fonts readMe
- Created skill: `fonts-folder.md`; added skill ref
- Created utils `.docs/DevelopmentRoadMap.md` and `Tickets.md` outlining cleanup: reorganize root files into categories (general, composition, data), consolidate colors.ts/themeColorUtils, split general.ts

### Results

- 5 additional architecture skills (colorSystem, createThemeUtils, designPalettes, fonts)
- Utils cleanup roadmap with 4 tickets (TKT-2025-009 through TKT-2025-012)

### Next

- [ ] Execute utils reorganization (TKT-2025-009)
- [ ] Consolidate color utilities (TKT-2025-010, TKT-2025-011)

## Session 4: Core Types & Context Documentation

### Work Done

- Updated readMe files for `src/core/types` (root, data, sport, cricket) with file descriptions, exports, parent links, dependencies
- Updated readMe for `src/core/context` with detailed context descriptions, provider flow, and dependencies
- Created skill: `core-types-folder.md` — structure, FixturaDataset schema, adding sport types or shared data shapes
- Created skill: `core-context-folder.md` — provider hierarchy, data flow, when to add/modify contexts
- Added skill references to `types/.docs/readMe.md` and `context/.docs/readMe.md`

### Results

- 17 architecture skills total (15 previous + core-types, core-context)
- Core types and context folders fully documented with skill guidance

### Next

- [ ] Execute utils reorganization (TKT-2025-009)
- [ ] Consolidate color utilities (TKT-2025-010, TKT-2025-011)

## Session 5: Climate Crisis Font & Brickwork Theme Update

### Work Done

- Added **Climate Crisis** font to the font system (`public/fonts/Climate_Crisis/ClimateCrisis-Regular-VariableFont_YEAR.ttf`):
  - `fontPathMap` entry in `fontLoader.ts`
  - `fontNameVariants` for case normalization (climate crisis, CLIMATE CRISIS, ClimateCrisis)
  - Added to `index.ts` display fonts (climateCrisis)
  - Updated `fonts/.docs/readMe.md` and `fonts-folder.md` skill
- Updated **Brickwork** template theme (`src/templates/variants/brickwork/theme.ts`) to use Climate Crisis as main font: title, subtitle, and copy all set to `"Climate Crisis"` (replacing Roboto-Medium)

### Results

- Climate Crisis available system-wide via `loadFontByName("Climate Crisis")` and theme config
- Brickwork compositions now render with Climate Crisis across all text roles

### Next

- [ ] None specific to this work

## Session 6: Components .md → .docs Migration

### Context

User requested moving all .md files into .docs folders per directory. Only move if not already in a .docs folder (per repo documentation rules).

### Work Done

- **Checked** (already in .docs): animations, backgrounds
- **Moved** .md files to .docs in: containers (7), easing (1), images (5), layout (9), transitions (1), typography (4)
- Updated cross-reference in layout/main/.docs/README.md: `./header/README.md` → `./header/.docs/README.md`

### Results

- 27 .md files moved into .docs across 6 component folders
- All component .md now follow .docs layout: animations, backgrounds, containers, easing, images, layout, transitions, typography

### Next

- [ ] Check remaining component folders (e.g. ui) if any .md remain outside .docs
- [ ] Execute utils reorganization (TKT-2025-009)

---

## Session 7: Animations, Backgrounds readMe Updates & TKT-2025-013

### Work Done

- Updated `components/animations` readMe (root, config) to standard folder contract format
- Updated `components/backgrounds` readMe (root + all children): config, hooks, variants, Solid, Gradient, Image, Video, Patterns, Particles, NoiseBackground, Textures, plus Patterns/variants, Particles/variants, NoiseBackground/variants, Image/variants, Image/overlays
- Created `components/.docs/Tickets.md` with TKT-2025-013: readMe standard format migration
- Listed completed work (core types, context, animations, backgrounds) and parent folders left: components root, containers, easing, images, layout, transitions, typography, ui
- Updated `components/.docs/DevelopmentRoadMap.md`: Current Focus (TKT-2025-013), To Do #1 for documentation, Documentation Status, Recent Updates

### Results

- Standard format readMes complete for animations and backgrounds (incl. all 20+ child folders)
- Ticket provides execution plan for remaining 8 parent folders and components root

### Next

- [ ] Update readMe for containers, easing, images, layout, transitions, typography, ui (per TKT-2025-013)
