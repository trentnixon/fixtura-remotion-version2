# Upcoming Cleanup Summary

Refactored all upcoming entry point files by consolidating shared utility functions into `_utils/calculations.ts` (both `_types` and `_utils` folders are in the current upcoming directory - create them if they don't exist). Extracted calculation utilities (`getGamesPerScreen`, `calculateDisplayDurationPerScreen`, `hasValidGames`, `calculateTotalScreens`) and constants (`DEFAULT_DISPLAY_DURATION`, `DEFAULT_GAMES_PER_SCREEN`) into the shared utilities file. Updated all 7 entry point files (basic.tsx, brickWork.tsx, classic.tsx, classicTwoColumn.tsx, cnsw.tsx, cnsw-private.tsx, sixersThunder.tsx) to use the shared utilities, removing duplicate calculation logic and improving code consistency. The `types.ts` file remains in the root as it contains domain types used across the entire upcoming module. All components now have consistent calculation logic and improved maintainability.
