# GamesDisplay Cleanup Summary

Refactored all GamesDisplay component files by consolidating shared types and utility functions. Extracted the `GamesDisplayProps` interface into `_types/GamesDisplayProps.ts` and calculation utilities (`calculateDisplayedGames`, `calculateGameCardHeight`, `mergeAssignSponsors`) into `_utils/calculations.ts` (both `_types` and `_utils` folders are in the current GamesDisplay directory - create them if they don't exist). Updated all 7 component files (FixtureDisplayBasic.tsx, FixtureDisplayBrickWork.tsx, FixtureDisplayClassic.tsx, FixtureDisplayClassicTwoColumn.tsx, FixtureDisplayCNSW.tsx, FixtureDisplayCNSW-private.tsx, FixtureDisplaySixersThunder.tsx) to use the shared types and utilities, removing duplicate interface definitions and calculation logic. The `calculateGameCardHeight` function accepts optional spacing configuration to support different layout requirements (e.g., ClassicTwoColumn uses custom spacing values). All components now have consistent calculation logic and improved maintainability.
