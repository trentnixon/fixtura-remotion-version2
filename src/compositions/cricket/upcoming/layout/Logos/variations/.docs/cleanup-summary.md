# Logos Variations Cleanup Summary

Refactored all logo variation components by reorganizing the existing `common.ts` file into a modular structure. Extracted the `TeamLayoutProps` interface into `_types/TeamLayoutProps.ts`, utility constants (`LOGO_SIZES`, `LOGO_POSITION_CLASSES`) into `_utils/helpers.ts`, and animation hook (`useLayoutAnimations`) into `_utils/animations.ts` (both `_types` and `_utils` folders are in the current variations directory - create them if they don't exist). Updated all 7 component files (LogosOnly.tsx, LogoAndName.tsx, MirroredAlignment.tsx, NameAboveLogo.tsx, OppositeAlignment.tsx, CenteredVerticalStack.tsx, ReversedMirrored.tsx) to import from the new modular structure. Extracted the `logoPositionClass` object from `LogosOnly.tsx` into the shared `LOGO_POSITION_CLASSES` constant in `_utils/helpers.ts`. The `common.ts` file now serves as a re-export file for backward compatibility, maintaining the same exports while delegating to the new modular structure. All components now have consistent imports and improved maintainability.
