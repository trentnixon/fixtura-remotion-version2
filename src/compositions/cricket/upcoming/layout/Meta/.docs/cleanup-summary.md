# Meta Cleanup Summary

Refactored all Meta component files by consolidating shared types and utility functions. Extracted component-specific prop interfaces into `_types/` folder (GroundTimeProps.ts, TeamNameProps.ts, SingleDataPointHeaderProps.ts, GradeProps.ts, GradeDateProps.ts, GroundProps.ts, TimeGroundProps.ts, TimeDateGroundProps.ts) and utility function (`truncateString`) into `_utils/helpers.ts` (both `_types` and `_utils` folders are in the current Meta directory - create them if they don't exist). Updated all 8 component files (GroundTime.tsx, TeamName.tsx, SingleDataPointHeader.tsx, Grade.tsx, GradeDate.tsx, Ground.tsx, TimeGround.tsx, TimeDateGround.tsx) to use the shared types and utilities, removing duplicate interface definitions and inline string truncation logic. The `truncateString` utility function handles null/undefined values and provides configurable max length. All components now have consistent type definitions and improved maintainability.
