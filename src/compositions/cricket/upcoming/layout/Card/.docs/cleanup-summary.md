# Card Cleanup Summary

Refactored all GameCard component files by consolidating shared types and utility functions. Extracted the `GameCardProps` interface into `_types/GameCardProps.ts` and calculation utilities (`calculateAnimationDelay`, `calculateAnimationOutFrame`) into `_utils/calculations.ts` (both `_types` and `_utils` folders are in the current Card directory - create them if they don't exist). Updated all 6 component files (game-card-basic.tsx, game-card-brickWork.tsx, game-card-cnsw.tsx, game-card-cnsw-private.tsx, game-card-Classic-Two-Column.tsx, game-card-sixersThunder.tsx) to use the shared types and utilities, removing duplicate interface definitions and calculation logic. The `calculateAnimationDelay` function accepts an optional multiplier parameter to support different animation speeds (basic/brickWork use `FAST_DELAY_MULTIPLIER` of 5, others use default of 15). All components now have consistent animation calculation logic and improved maintainability.
