# Ticket – TKT-2025-001 ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Optimize sponsor image sizing to maximize display size while respecting container constraints and maintaining proper aspect ratios.

## Summary

**Problem Solved:** Sponsor images were forced into square containers, limiting their display size and distorting aspect ratios.

**Solution Implemented:**

- Removed square constraints from container styling
- Added dynamic width sizing with `calculateMaxWidth()` function using actual logo dimensions
- Uses natural aspect ratio from logo.width/logo.height when available
- Fallback to 3:1 ratio only when dimensions are missing
- Added `preserveRatio={true}` to maintain aspect ratios
- Improved container layout with `overflow-hidden` and `flex-shrink-0`
- Enhanced accessibility with proper alt text

**Impact:** Sponsor logos now maximize display size while maintaining proper aspect ratios, with no artificial constraints.

# Ticket – TKT-2025-002 ✅ COMPLETED

## Overview

Refactor SponsorFooter component to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability.

## Summary

**Problem Solved:** Massive code duplication between main component and IncludePrimarySponsor, poor performance, and lack of proper organization.

**Solution Implemented:**

- Created `useSponsorValidation` hook to consolidate all validation logic
- Extracted `PrimarySponsor` component to separate file for better organization
- Added `React.memo` optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented `useMemo` for expensive sponsor list calculations
- Improved code organization with proper folder structure (`components/`, `hooks/`)
- Added configuration constants for maintainability
- Fixed React Hook order issues and TypeScript errors

**Impact:** Eliminated 50+ lines of duplicated code, improved performance, and created maintainable component architecture.
